# Teaching-Scratch
Hi everyone, thank you for looking at my Teaching-Scratch repository!

In this repository, I will present all the Scratch files from https://scratch.mit.edu/
All of these projects that are here are made by me

And I also want to give the credits to Coding with Kids, LLC for the curriculums of the projects
Have fun and thank you for visiting :)
